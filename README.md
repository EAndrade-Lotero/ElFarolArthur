# ElFarolArthur

**ElFarolArthur** is a Python implementation of Brian Arthur's method of predictors to solve [El Farol Bar problem](https://sites.santafe.edu/~wbarthur/elfarol.htm).

---

## Overview

The primary goal of ElFarolArthur is to allow us to understand the **method of predictors**, proposed by Brian Arthur as a solution to the problem. There are three main modules:

- **bar_classes**: Contains the class definition for predictors, agents and bar.
- **sim_utils**: Contains the methods to run the simulations and sweeps.
- **data_utils**: Contains the methods to obtain some of the measures used in our analyses.

This repository also contains the Jupyter notebooks used to create the figures for our paper:

[1] "A paradox in Brian Arthur's solution to his El Farol bar problem" *under review*.
